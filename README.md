# Citi Bike Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

Welcome to the Citi Bike Analysis Dashboard! This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the New York Citi Bike program, the largest bike-sharing initiative in the United States. The dashboard was created to assist city officials and stakeholders in understanding key trends, optimizing resources, and improving the program's overall performance.

The dashboard is publicly available on Tableau Public: [Link for Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tinkle.jain/viz/CitiBikeAnalysis_17344146310290/FinalPresentation)


## Project Goals

To generate data-driven insights and identify unexpected phenomena within the Citi Bike data.

To create visualizations and dashboards that are insightful, visually appealing, and easy to understand for non-technical stakeholders.

To support city officials in making informed decisions by answering specific questions about the program's performance and utilization.


## Visualizations

1. Dashboards

    Two interactive dashboards are provided:
    
    Utilization Trends Dashboard: Focused on ridership trends, peak hours, and user demographics.
    
    Station Performance Dashboard: Highlights the most and least popular stations and includes a map visualization.

2. Map Visualization

    A dynamic map plots all bike stations in New York City with:
    
    Markers indicating popularity by color.
    
    Filters to explore data by month.
    
    Zip code overlays for geographic context.

3. Tableau Story

    The project brings together visualizations, dashboards, and the map into a cohesive Tableau story. This story:
    
    Is logically organized and easy to navigate.
    
    Includes interactive elements for a user-friendly experience.
    
    Provides clear analyses to answer key questions.

## Key Findings

1. Unexpected Phenomena

    Significant growth in weekday morning and evening ridership, indicating increased use by commuters.
    
    A disparity in station popularity, with certain areas experiencing much higher traffic due to proximity to transit hubs and business districts.

2. Station Insights

    Top stations are located near major attractions and transit points.
    
    Underutilized stations are often in residential or less accessible areas.
